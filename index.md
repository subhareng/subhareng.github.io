## Business Savvy Data Scientist

Welcome to my homepage. I'm Subha, a current student in the Master of Business Analytics program at MIT. It's a 1 year program in data science co-hosted through the Operations Research Center and the Sloan School of Management. Before coming to MIT, I was a management consultant for Protiviti in San Francisco and a graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied Applied Mathematics from the College of Letters and Science and Business Administration from the Haas School of Business.
